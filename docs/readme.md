Ok, eventually I might want to host stuff in here on a docs-ish website. For now this serves as a place for me to write little Quarto notebooks for some
of the models. I am doing this for two reasons:

1. I want a convenient place to test out some of the models, before I get actual testing set up. Simply sampling and plotting the models is OK for this.
2. I want to actually understand some of the modelling decisions, and to do that I'm writing notes about them anyways.
3. I might want to turn any of these that are interesting into Tutorials (see 2.)
